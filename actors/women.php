$HOOK = '<p class="hook">Gender equality is, first and foremost, a human right. Women are entitled to live in dignity and in freedom from want and from fear. Empowering women is also an <em>indispensable tool for advancing development and reducing poverty.</em></p> 

<p class="hook">Yet discrimination against women and girls&#8212;including gender-based violence, economic discrimination, reproductive health inequities, and harmful traditional practices&#8212;remains the most pervasive and persistent form of inequality. Women and girls bear enormous hardship during and after humanitarian emergencies, especially armed conflicts.</p>
