<p class="hook"><em>One in four high school students in America don&#8217;t graduate</em>&#8212;one in three among black and Hispanic populations. Reading, math, and science achievement scores for American public school students rank average to below average compared to <span class="caps">OECD</span> nations, with little improvement since 2000. These facts, and a host of others, point to what many agree is an <em>education system in crisis.</em></p>


	<p class="hook">There is less agreement, though, on the causes of the crisis, and still less on the solutions. The usual suspects in these discussions are the following: standards and accountability, student-centered pedagogy, school choice, and funding reform.</p>
